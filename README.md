# code
<h1>helper_functions.py</h1>

contains a set of common functions that are imported by other python programs.

<h1>n-gen-bcf.py </h1>
(Usage: ./n-gen-bcf.py <b>Y</b>)
generates negative binary cubic forms. This is not a parallelized implementation and requires significant memory. For example, Y=100B takes about 80% of 256G RAM and about 200 minutes on a 64 CPU machine (m4.16xlarge). Usage: ./n-gen-bcf.py <Y>

<h1>p-gen-bcf.py</h1>
(Usage: ./p-gen-bcf <b>Y</b> <b>processors</b> <b>TEMP_FOLDER</b>)
generates positive binary cubic forms. This is a parallelized implementation that can use multiple cores. Multiple files are generated and then concatenated for the final result.
